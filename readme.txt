  This project is very much dependent on rdesktop and the work of Matt Chapman
  and the rdesktop team members, of which I'm a member

  Mark from up 19.9 was the first to work with rdp server code.

To use this run make the ./xrdp, then connect with rdesktop or mstsc.
Only tested with linux and i386.
